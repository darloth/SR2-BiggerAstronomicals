		Makes planets, stars and black holes BIGGER!

		Suns are about twice as large, planets are about three times as large as they did seem a little small, and the galactic black hole is BIG now.  You'll probably want to increase both the system size and spacing a bit larger than the default, as otherwise everything looks a little cramped.  On the other hand, if you're one of those people who play with big systems and vast spacing regularly, this mod should help make everything look a little more to scale.  There's also more of a random range of planet sizes, since they seemed a bit similar.

		Planet surfaces should be mostly the same, perhaps a little bigger, and hitpoints of stellar objects is increased a bit as a side effect.  Since graviton condensers that can pop planets double-quick are fairly easy to make, I'm not going to struggle to fix this, but you should be aware.

		Thanks to Darknote for inspiring this mod and prompting an investigation into the map generation.
